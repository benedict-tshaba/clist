28/08/2017    -    Changed from using a hash table to just implementing a
simple array. Should be more efficient now. Removed hash function, and its
dependencies, now indexing using table 'size'.

	      -    Implemented Pop function.
	      -	   Implemented remove_item function.

02/09/2017    -    Implemented sort_asc function. But later realised that a
redesign was necessary.

04/09/2017    -    Redesigned the library, now each item in the list has
associated with it a 'representation' in the form of a long int, this should
make it easier to sort elements without being confined only to quadratic time
algorithms. Since the elements will be represented as a long int, sorting and
other data manipulations should be trivial.
